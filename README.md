The HTML links in the  Table of Contents does not work; this is a known issue: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github

Use Nbviewer instead: https://nbviewer.org/github/ais0219/EDA_projects/blob/main/EDA_sepsis_kaggle.ipynb
